Function and Variable Names
    Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
    Variable names follow the same convention as function names.
    mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where thatâ€™s already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain backwards compatibility.
